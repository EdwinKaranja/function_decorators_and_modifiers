The logger function employs Decorators, a Python feature used to enhance the functionality of functions, by capturing their input arguments and output values. If the same function is invoked again, the logger function accesses this stored information, allowing it to replicate the function's behavior.

The "run again" is a code thaterves to re-execute a function if it encounters an error during its initial execution. This capability enables the logger function to handle errors gracefully by attempting to rerun the function, providing an opportunity for it to completed successfully.
